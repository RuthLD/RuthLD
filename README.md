- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @RuthLD
- ðŸ’¬ Introduction:
  - Both of my degrees were research-focused and completed in excel using pivot tables and the data analysis add-on. 
  - I am prepared to write SQL commands, use Python-based scripts, and create in-depth data visualizations from CSV files and APIs.  
  - In my past projects, I have evaluated data to identify trends over the calendar year and how those trends can plan for maximum returns. 
  - To enhance the written report I created at the end of the analysis, I created charts using Matplotlib, including pie charts representing the total percentage by each category present in the data.
